# Swift-Tutorial-Custom-Title-View

Sample project in response to StackOverflow question https://stackoverflow.com/questions/46332857/custom-nav-title-offset-ios-11/46352164#46352164

- Xcode 9
- Swift 4

Unlicensed. Enjoy!

notes:
- The custom view background was left white to better visualize its positioning, reader should probably edit the Xib file and set the background color to "Clear"
